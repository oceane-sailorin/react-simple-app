# react-simple-app

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About : Add Registration and Login to your React App
To quickly integrate registration and login into your React application, IndyKite has created a modern, easy-to-use JavaScript UI-SDK.  Using the UI-SDK removes the complexity of building login and registration flows into your application.  Coupled with the customizable, drag-and-drop authentication flows built in the Admin Console you can use the SDK to add login and registration to your application in minutes.

To use this quickstart, you'll need:
* A free IndyKite account or log in to the IndyKite Admin Console
* An existing React application or you can setup one with Create-React-App
